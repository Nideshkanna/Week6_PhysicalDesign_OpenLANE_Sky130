# ‚öôÔ∏è Day 2 ‚Äî Good Floorplan vs Bad Floorplan & Introduction to Library Cells

## üß© RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program

Welcome to **Day 2** of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, where we explore one of the most crucial physical-design stages ‚Äî **chip floorplanning** and **standard-cell characterization**.

This day builds on the synthesized netlist generated in **Day 1** and focuses on how cells, pins, and power networks are **arranged and optimized** on silicon to achieve design closure.

## üß± 1. Chip Floorplanning

### üîπ Definition

Chip floorplanning is the process of arranging **macros, standard cells, and I/O pins** within the chip core area. It ensures proper connectivity, minimizes routing congestion, and establishes a balanced power distribution across the die.

### üîπ Key Metrics

#### ‚û§ Utilization Factor

$[Utilization\ Factor = \frac{Area\ used\ by\ Standard\ Cells}{Total\ Core\ Area}]$

Typical range: **0.5 ‚Äì 0.7 (50 ‚Äì 70 %)**
A good utilization factor leaves sufficient whitespace for routing and clock-tree insertion.

#### ‚û§ Aspect Ratio

$[Aspect\ Ratio = \frac{Height}{Width}]$

A square-like core (aspect ratio ‚âà 1) helps achieve uniform routing and power balance.

---

## ‚ö° 2. Power Planning

Power planning defines **VDD/VSS grid structures** that distribute power evenly across the die and reduce **IR drop** & **ground bounce**.
By minimizing voltage variation, cells maintain consistent switching speed and noise immunity.

## üìç 3. Pin Placement

Pin placement affects signal delay, buffer insertion, and congestion.
Common strategies include:

* **Equidistant Placement** ‚Äì pins distributed evenly along edges.
* **High-Density Placement** ‚Äì grouping pins to shorten interconnects for specific blocks.

## üß≠ 4. Floorplanning in OpenLANE

### üß∞ Command Flow

```bash
# Enter OpenLANE docker
docker

# Inside interactive mode
./flow.tcl -interactive
package require openlane 0.9
prep -design picorv32a
run_synthesis
run_floorplan
```

This generates the **floorplan DEF file**, which contains die area, core dimensions, pin locations, and power grid layout.

---

### üìä Output Example

```
[INFO]: Running Floorplan...
[STEP 1]: Reading config.tcl
[STEP 2]: Creating Core Area
[STEP 3]: Inserting Tapcells & Decaps
[STEP 4]: Generating pin placement
[INFO]: Floorplan completed successfully.
```

### üìè Die Area Calculation

From `picorv32a.floorplan.def` :

```
DIEAREA ( 0 0 ) ( 660685 671405 )
1000 unit distance = 1 micron
```

**Die Width** = 660685 / 1000 = 660.685 Œºm  
**Die Height** = 671405 / 1000 = 671.405 Œºm  
**Area** = 660.685 √ó 671.405 = 443,587.21 Œºm¬≤

## üß© 5. Visualizing Floorplan in Magic

To view the floorplan:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/<run_dir>/results/floorplan/
magic -T $PDK_ROOT/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech \
      lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef \
      def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &
```

**Required Files**

1. `sky130A.tech` ‚Äì Technology file
2. `merged.lef` ‚Äì Physical library information
3. `picorv32a.floorplan.def` ‚Äì Generated layout

## üßÆ 6. Placement Stage

### üìå Purpose

Placement determines the **exact locations of standard cells** within the core region to optimize **timing, congestion, and area**.

It occurs in two phases:

* **Global Placement:** Rough cell positioning based on timing and connectivity.
* **Detailed Placement:** Legalizes cell positions to avoid overlaps and minimize wire length.

### üîß Command Execution

```tcl
run_placement
```

### üîç Inspect Placement in Magic

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/<run_dir>/results/placement/
magic -T $PDK_ROOT/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech \
      lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef \
      def read picorv32a.placement.def &
```

## üß† 7. Cell Design and Characterization Flows

### üî∏ Cell Design Flow

Cell design involves **schematic creation**, **layout design**, and **DRC/LVS verification**.
Each standard cell is designed once and reused during synthesis and placement.

### üî∏ Characterization Flow

Characterization converts the transistor-level design into **timing, power, and functional models** for use by synthesis and STA tools.

**Stages in Characterization Flow:**

1. Netlist Extraction
2. Specification of Parameters
3. Model Selection
4. SPICE Simulations & Measurement
5. Model Generation
6. Verification
